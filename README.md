Problem – Now the society has changed a lot, but still there is a gap between the women and the men. Especially in European countries, there is a big salary gap, and more priorities are going on. And the sophisticated platform will be more revealing women’s photos and video and it puts them in a spot. And also, it is acceptable that the women face most of the security threads on these platforms. Women’s could have use the internet like men’s do but because of these vulnerabilities they have to keep their life private and kind of restricted by the society. And women have personal issues that they can’t discuss in public websites, and they feel like they could have a social media or a platform for women only, there they can have chat with women’s and they could have conversations and chat with the follow gender people with the same kind of issues. It will help them to solve and ease the problems.

Solution- The website that we are planning to design is a platform there only the women can use it. It will provide path way for every women to express their feeling, spread their thoughts, learn new information that are totally related to women, and they could have use this platform without any security issues and data breaches, and in future we could have add the machine learning technologies to the platform and it will help the platform to add more security and more reliability to the platforms. From the registration phase to the post-management all stages are designed in a secure manner and additionally classification technology would have contributed more to the idea. The website mainly focuses on the that the platform is going to spread and it is going to provide a secure platform for the women.
