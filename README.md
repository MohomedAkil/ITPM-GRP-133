Sustainability Goal - Gender Equality
Topic - Women Entreprenuers Management System

In addition to being a fundamental human right, gender equality is also a precondition for a world that is stable, affluent, and sustainable. Although there has been progress in recent decades, gender equality will not be achieved by the year 2030 as planned.

Services for women's health, which were already underfunded, have been severely disrupted. Women continue to experience a lot of violence. And even though women took the lead in responding to COVID-19, they still lag behind males in obtaining the leadership roles they deserve.

It is must to encourage women to show their skills to the world and let the world know what they can do. Therefore we believe this management system will manage women entreprenuers with their details, stories adn much more etc. and encourage others to come forward as well.
